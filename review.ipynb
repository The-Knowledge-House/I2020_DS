Since that can lead to an endless loop, we must include an exit condition that will break out of the repeated function calls.

Usually that's an indication that we might need recursion because to get the result of `n!`, we must do `n-1!` and to get `n-1!` we must do `n-2! ` and so on. We also see that `0!` is `1` which gives us a condition we can exit our recursive looping with. We can also see that if `n` is a number greater than `0`, subtracting `1` from it will get us closer to `0`. So we know if we calculate `n!`, `n-1!`, `n-2!` and so on, eventually we'll get to a value to calculate that is `0`.\n",

    "Object inheritance allows us to create classes that are based off already existing classes. This means we don't have to rewrite a lot of code if it already exists. If there's a class we'd like to extend, we can create a new class that inherits from it and all of the functionality provided by the base class is available to our new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of inheritance, we can usually create generic classes that provide general functionality and then use that as a base class to create more specific classes that use functionality from the generic base class and extends it in ways that apply to that specific class. An example of this would be a `Shape` class. We can define attributes and methods that apply to all shapes. Then we can create specific classes like `Rectangle` and `Circle` that inherit the attributes/methods from `Shape` but extends the functionality to apply to those specific shapes. In this way, you can think of a sub class (a class inheriting from a base class) as a more specific version of the base class. \n",
