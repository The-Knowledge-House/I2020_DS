    "What is REST\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is acronym for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 main principles of REST:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client–server** – By separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stateless** – Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cacheable** – Cache constraints require that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If a response is cacheable, then a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later, equivalent requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uniform interface** – By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved. In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints are needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layered system** – The layered system style allows an architecture to be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior such that each component cannot “see” beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code on demand** (optional) – REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented."

    "### How REST APIs work:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs use HTTP (i.e., HyperText Transfer Protocol, the language of the web) to process data requests. The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The GET request retrieves data from a resource. For example, you’d use a GET request to retrieve a record from a database.\n",
    "* The POST request creates a new resource, such as a new record in a database.\n",
    "* The PUT request updates an existing resource.\n",
    "* The DELETE request deletes a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs can be programmed with a number of languages, including Python, Node.js, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use Rest APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides specifying your data request, working with REST APIs also requires specifying the languages it supports, how responses should be formatted, how to use callback information, if there are API keys involved, and any request limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you work through those details, here’s what you’ll need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find your endpoint: HTTP requests depend on a particular URL, and root endpoints may be formatted differently depending on the API you’re using. You also need to determine the path or the resource you’re requesting, which may involve looking through the API documentation.\n",
    "2. Choose your method: You can use REST APIs to send any of the requests mentioned earlier—GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE—as well as a few others. In all cases, the methods allow you to perform functions like Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting, (otherwise known as CRUD).\n",
    "3. Identify your header: If a REST API request is like sending a letter, think of headers as the envelope containing valuable information for the person receiving it. In this case, the header could have details that help explain what will be in the “body” content of the request or, perhaps, important information about authentication and security. Headers can be grouped by their context or how various proxies handle them.\n",
    "4. Determine if you need message data: If your requirements include sending specific information to the server—in POST, PUT, or DELETE requests, for example—this becomes what is sometimes referred to as the “body” of your requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of what happens at this stage will be influenced in part by the platform you use to work with REST APIs, the most common choices being Python and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Format of REST API data\n",
    "\n",
    "REST API's most commonly use JSON as the format for the data. XML and other formats are used as well but for the most part, we'll assume that we use JSON to communicate with REST APIs."
