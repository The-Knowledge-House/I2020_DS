    "`first_name` and `last_name` are [fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/#fields) of the model. Each field is specified as a class attribute, and each attribute maps to a database column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above Person model would create a database table like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE myapp_person (\n",
    "    \"id\" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "    \"last_name\" varchar(30) NOT NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Some technical notes:\n",
    "* The name of the table, `myapp_person`, is automatically derived from some model metadata but can be overridden. See [Table names](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/options/#table-names) for more details.\n",
    "* An `id` field is added automatically, but this behavior can be overridden. See [Automatic primary key fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/#automatic-primary-key-fields).\n",
    "* The `CREATE TABLE` SQL in this example is formatted using PostgreSQL syntax, but it’s worth noting Django uses SQL tailored to the database backend specified in your [settings file](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/settings/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using models\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have defined your models, you need to tell Django you’re going to use those models. Do this by editing your settings file and changing the [`INSTALLED_APPS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-INSTALLED_APPS) setting to add the name of the module that contains your `models.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the models for your application live in the module `myapp.models` (the package structure that is created for an application by the [`manage.py startapp`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-startapp) script), [`INSTALLED_APPS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-INSTALLED_APPS) should read, in part:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "INSTALLED_APPS = [\n",
    "    #...\n",
    "    'myapp',\n",
    "    #...\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add new apps to [`INSTALLED_APPS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-INSTALLED_APPS), be sure to run `manage.py migrate`, optionally making migrations for them first with `manage.py makemigrations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of a model – and the only required part of a model – is the list of database fields it defines. Fields are specified by class attributes. Be careful not to choose field names that conflict with the models API like clean, save, or delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Musician(models.Model):\n",
    "    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n",
    "    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n",
    "    instrument = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Album(models.Model):\n",
    "    artist = models.ForeignKey(Musician, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n",
    "    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    release_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "    num_stars = models.IntegerField()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field types\n",
    "\n",
    "Each field in your model should be an instance of the appropriate Field class. Django uses the field class types to determine a few things:\n",
    "* The column type, which tells the database what kind of data to store (e.g. `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`).\n",
    "* The default HTML widget to use when rendering a form field (e.g. `<input type=\"text\">`, `<select>`).\n",
    "* The minimal validation requirements, used in Django’s admin and in automatically-generated forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django ships with dozens of built-in field types; you can find the complete list in the [model field reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#model-field-types). You can easily write your own fields if Django’s built-in ones don’t do the trick; see [Writing custom model fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/custom-model-fields/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field options\n",
    "\n",
    "Each field takes a certain set of field-specific arguments (documented in the [model field reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#model-field-types)). For example, [`CharField`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.CharField) (and its subclasses) require a [`max_length`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.CharField.max_length) argument which specifies the size of the `VARCHAR` database field used to store the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s also a set of common arguments available to all field types. All are optional. They’re fully explained in the [`reference`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#common-model-field-options), but here’s a quick summary of the most often-used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "**[`null`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.null)**  \n",
    "If `True`, Django will store empty values as `NULL` in the database. Default is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[`blank`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.blank)**  \n",
    "If `True`, the field is allowed to be blank. Default is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is different than `null`. `null` is purely database-related, whereas blank is validation-related. If a field has `blank=True`, form validation will allow entry of an empty value. If a field has `blank=False`, the field will be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[`choices`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.choices)**  \n",
    "A [sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence) of 2-tuples to use as choices for this field. If this is given, the default form widget will be a select box instead of the standard text field and will limit choices to the choices given.\n",
    "\n",
    "A choices list looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = [\n",
    "        ('FR', 'Freshman'),\n",
    "        ('SO', 'Sophomore'),\n",
    "        ('JR', 'Junior'),\n",
    "        ('SR', 'Senior'),\n",
    "        ('GR', 'Graduate'),\n",

    "### Automatic primary key fields\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Django gives each model an auto-incrementing primary key with the type specified per app in `AppConfig.default_auto_field` or globally in the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "id = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’d like to specify a custom primary key, specify `primary_key=True` on one of your fields. If Django sees you’ve explicitly set `Field.primary_key`, it won’t add the automatic `id` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model requires exactly one field to have `primary_key=True` (either explicitly declared or automatically added).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verbose field names¶\n",
    "\n",
    "Each field type, except for `ForeignKey`, `ManyToManyField` and `OneToOneField`, takes an optional first positional argument – a verbose name. If the verbose name isn’t given, Django will automatically create it using the field’s attribute name, converting underscores to spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the verbose name is \"person's first name\":\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_name = models.CharField(\"person's first name\", max_length=30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the verbose name is \"first name\":\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "`ForeignKey`, `ManyToManyField` and `OneToOneField` require the first argument to be a model class, so use the verbose_name keyword argument:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "poll = models.ForeignKey(\n",
    "    Poll,\n",
    "    on_delete=models.CASCADE,\n",
    "    verbose_name=\"the related poll\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "sites = models.ManyToManyField(Site, verbose_name=\"list of sites\")\n",

    "    on_delete=models.CASCADE,\n",
    "    verbose_name=\"related place\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The convention is not to capitalize the first letter of the verbose_name. Django will automatically capitalize the first letter where it needs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the power of relational databases lies in relating tables to each other. Django offers ways to define the three most common types of database relationships: **many-to-one**, **many-to-many** and **one-to-one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many-to-one relationships**\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a many-to-one relationship, use `django.db.models.ForeignKey`. You use it just like any other Field type: by including it as a class attribute of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`ForeignKey`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey) requires a positional argument: the class to which the model is related.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a `Car` model has a `Manufacturer` – that is, a `Manufacturer` makes multiple cars but each `Car` only has one `Manufacturer` – use the following definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Manufacturer(models.Model):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(models.Model):\n",
    "    manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(Manufacturer, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also create [recursive relationships](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#recursive-relationships) (an object with a many-to-one relationship to itself) and [relationships to models not yet defined](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#lazy-relationships); see the [model field reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#ref-foreignkey) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s suggested, but not required, that the name of a `ForeignKey` field (manufacturer in the example above) be the name of the model, lowercase. You can call the field whatever you want. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car(models.Model):\n",
    "    company_that_makes_it = models.ForeignKey(\n",
    "        Manufacturer,\n",
    "        on_delete=models.CASCADE,\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "See also:\n",
    "* [`ForeignKey`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey) fields accept a number of extra arguments which are explained in the [model field reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#foreign-key-arguments). These options help define how the relationship should work; all are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details on accessing backwards-related objects, see the [Following relationships backward example](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/#backwards-related-objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "For sample code, see the [Many-to-one relationship model example](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many-to-many relationships**\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a many-to-many relationship, use `ManyToManyField`. You use it just like any other `Field` type: by including it as a class attribute of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ManyToManyField` requires a positional argument: the class to which the model is related.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a `Pizza` has multiple `Topping` objects – that is, a `Topping` can be on multiple pizzas and each `Pizza` has multiple toppings – here’s how you’d represent that:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Topping(models.Model):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Pizza(models.Model):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    toppings = models.ManyToManyField(Topping)\n",
    "```\n",
    "As with `ForeignKey`, you can also create [recursive relationships](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#recursive-relationships) (an object with a many-to-many relationship to itself) and [relationships to models not yet defin)d](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#lazy-relationships(.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s suggested, but not required, that the name of a `ManyToManyField` (toppings in the example above) be a plural describing the set of related model objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t matter which model has the `ManyToManyField`, but you should only put it in one of the models – not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, `ManyToManyField` instances should go in the object that’s going to be edited on a form. In the above example, **toppings** is in `Pizza` (rather than `Topping` having a pizzas `ManyToManyField` ) because it’s more natural to think about a pizza having toppings than a topping being on multiple pizzas. The way it’s set up above, the `Pizza` form would let users select the toppings.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Many-to-many relationship model example]() for a full example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One-to-one relationships**\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a one-to-one relationship, use `OneToOneField`. You use it just like any other Field type: by including it as a class attribute of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is most useful on the primary key of an object when that object “extends” another object in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "`OneToOneField` requires a positional argument: the class to which the model is related.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you were building a database of “places”, you would build pretty standard stuff such as address, phone number, etc. in the database. Then, if you wanted to build a database of restaurants on top of the places, instead of repeating yourself and replicating those fields in the `Restaurant` model, you could make `Restaurant` have a `OneToOneField` to `Place` (because a restaurant “is a” place; in fact, to handle this you’d typically use inheritance, which involves an implicit one-to-one relation).\n",
    "\n",
    "As with `ForeignKey`, a recursive relationship can be defined and references to as-yet undefined models can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [One-to-one relationship model example](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/examples/one_to_one/) for a full example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models across files\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s perfectly OK to relate a model to one from another app. To do this, import the related model at the top of the file where your model is defined. Then, refer to the other model class wherever needed. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "from geography.models import ZipCode\n",
    "\n",
    "class Restaurant(models.Model):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    zip_code = models.ForeignKey(\n",
    "        ZipCode,\n",
    "        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,\n",
    "        blank=True,\n",
    "        null=True,\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field name restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Django places some restrictions on model field names:\n",
    "* A field name cannot be a Python reserved word, because that would result in a Python syntax error. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class Example(models.Model):\n",
    "        pass = models.IntegerField() # 'pass' is a reserved word!\n",
    "```\n",
    "* A field name cannot contain more than one underscore in a row, due to the way Django’s query lookup syntax works. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class Example(models.Model):\n",
    "        foo__bar = models.IntegerField() # 'foo__bar' has two underscores!\n",
    "```\n",
    "* A field name cannot end with an underscore, for similar reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations can be worked around, though, because your field name doesn’t necessarily have to match your database column name. See the [db_column option](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.db_column).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL reserved words, such as join, where or select, are allowed as model field names, because Django escapes all database table names and column names in every underlying SQL query. It uses the quoting syntax of your particular database engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom field types\n",
    "\n",
    "If one of the existing model fields cannot be used to fit your purposes, or if you wish to take advantage of some less common database column types, you can create your own field class. Full coverage of creating your own fields is provided in Writing custom model fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important attribute of a model is the [`Manager`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/managers/#django.db.models.Manager). It’s the interface through which database query operations are provided to Django models and is used to retrieve the instances from the database. If no custom Manager is defined, the default name is objects. Managers are only accessible via model classes, not the model instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Define custom methods on a model to add custom “row-level” functionality to your objects. Whereas `Manager` methods are intended to do “table-wide” things, model methods should act on a particular model instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a valuable technique for keeping business logic in one place – the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this model has a few custom methods:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person(models.Model):\n",
    "    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n",
    "    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n",
    "    birth_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def baby_boomer_status(self):\n",
    "        \"Returns the person's baby-boomer status.\"\n",
    "        import datetime\n",
    "        if self.birth_date < datetime.date(1945, 8, 1):\n",
    "            return \"Pre-boomer\"\n",
    "        elif self.birth_date < datetime.date(1965, 1, 1):\n",
    "            return \"Baby boomer\"\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return \"Post-boomer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def full_name(self):\n",
    "        \"Returns the person's full name.\"\n",
    "        return '%s %s' % (self.first_name, self.last_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method in this example is a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model instance reference has a complete list of methods automatically given to each model. You can override most of these but there are a couple that you’ll almost always want to define:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`__str__()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python “magic method” that returns a string representation of any object. This is what Python and Django will use whenever a model instance needs to be coerced and displayed as a plain string. Most notably, this happens when you display an object in an interactive console or in the admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll always want to define this method; the default isn’t very helpful at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`get_absolute_url()`**  \n",
    "This tells Django how to calculate the URL for an object. Django uses this in its admin interface, and any time it needs to figure out a URL for an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any object that has a URL that uniquely identifies it should define this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overriding predefined model methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s another set of model methods that encapsulate a bunch of database behavior that you’ll want to customize. In particular you’ll often want to change the way `save()` and `delete()` work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re free to override these methods (and any other model method) to alter behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic use-case for overriding the built-in methods is if you want something to happen whenever you save an object. For example (see save() for documentation of the parameters it accepts):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Blog(models.Model):\n",
    "    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    tagline = models.TextField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        do_something()\n",
    "        super().save(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the \"real\" save() method.\n",
    "        do_something_else()\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also prevent saving:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Blog(models.Model):\n",
    "    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    tagline = models.TextField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        if self.name == \"Yoko Ono's blog\":\n",
    "            return # Yoko shall never have her own blog!\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            super().save(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the \"real\" save() method.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to remember to call the superclass method – that’s that `super().save(*args, **kwargs)` business – to ensure that the object still gets saved into the database. If you forget to call the superclass method, the default behavior won’t happen and the database won’t get touched.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s also important that you pass through the arguments that can be passed to the model method – that’s what the `*args, **kwargs` bit does. Django will, from time to time, extend the capabilities of built-in model methods, adding new arguments. If you use `*args, **kwargs` in your method definitions, you are guaranteed that your code will automatically support those arguments when they are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overridden model methods are not called on bulk operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `delete()` method for an object is not necessarily called when deleting objects in bulk using a QuerySet or as a result of a cascading delete. To ensure customized delete logic gets executed, you can use pre_delete and/or post_delete signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there isn’t a workaround when creating or updating objects in bulk, since none of `save()`, `pre_save`, and `post_save` are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing custom SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common pattern is writing custom SQL statements in model methods and module-level methods. For more details on using raw SQL, see the documentation on using [raw SQL](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/sql/).\n"
